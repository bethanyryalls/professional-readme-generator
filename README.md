# Professional README Generator

## Description
A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

The criteria for this project:
- When a user answers the prompt questions, they are displayed in the README.md under the correct section headings
- When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README.md and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License
- When a user enters their GitHub username, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions as a link to their GitHub profile
- When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them
- When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.md
